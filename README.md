# Software-Renderer
A software renderer I made using C++ and SDL for 2D display of rendered results.
Can currently rasterize point graphs, wireframes, flat shaded objects, smooth shaded objects, gourand shaded objects, it can sample textures
for a quite a few of the shading techniques and can do flat shaded ray tracing. To switch between reseults you can use the keys 1-0 and
to rotate the object viewed you can use wasd. You can also use ijkl to move the camera around.
